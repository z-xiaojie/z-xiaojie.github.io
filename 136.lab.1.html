    <h1 align="center">Lab 1 - Introduction to Linux and C++<br>
    </h1>
    <h3>Due: end of class</h3>
    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Recall that the Linux file system is tree-structured, with files
      and directories. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Some useful linux/unix CLI (command line interface) commands are:
    </p>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li> man &lt;command&gt;: description of command, including all
        its options</li>
      <li>ls: list files in current directory. <br>
      </li>
      <li>pwd: print working directory (i.e., current directory)<br>
      </li>
      <li>cd &lt;dir&gt;: change directory. Some useful values of
        &lt;dir&gt; include . (current), .. (parent), / (root of file
        system), and ~ (home)</li>
      <li>mkdir &lt;dir&gt;: make a directory in your current working
        directory</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you need a refresher, there is a simple tutorial <a
        href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html">here.
      </a><br>
    </p>
    <p>Also recall that some standard editors for Linux include gedit,
      emacs, and vim. You may use any of these, though emacs and vim are
      most common in the CS world. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Task 0<br>
    </h3>
    <p>To avoid cluttering your home directory, create a directory
      titled lab1. The instructor's home directory contains a small
      program whose name starts with "." and ends with "1a.cpp". If you
      don't know how to find the file, use man to find the proper ls
      option (and/or use wildcards). Find this file, copy it to
      ~/lab1/lab1a.cpp, compile (using g++ -o lab1a lab1a.cpp), and run
      it (./lab1a). What does it output? <br>
    </p>
    <p>One problem with the program is that it does not output a
      carriage return (so, the prompt for the next command is on the
      same line). Edit the program to add your instructor's name at the
      end of the output, and also fix the above problem. Rerun. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Task 1<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Write a program in ~/lab1/lab1b.cpp that outputs "Good morning
      &lt;instructor&gt;.", "Good afternoon &lt;instructor&gt;.", or
      "Good evening &lt;instructor&gt;." depending on whether the
      current time is midnight-noon, noon-sunset, or sunset-midnight
      respectively.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Your program should first prompt the user for the sunset time
      with the following prompts, inputting data using cin (e.g., "cin
      &gt;&gt; cur_hour") after each prompt:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>Enter the hours part of today's sunset time (4-9):<br>
        Enter the minutes part of today's sunset time (0-59):<br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    For this assignment, you may assume that the user enters a legal
    value, and you should not do any error checking (since this is just
    the first day of class!). These values obviously won't work in the
    Arctic, but we won't worry about that either. <br>
    <p>You will also need to retrieve the current time (24 hour format).
      A standard platform-independent way to do this is through the
      ctime library. Since you have not covered enough C/C++ to use this
      yet, you can just cut/paste the following sequence to get the
      current hour/min:<font size="+1"><tt><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; time_t t;</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; struct tm *now;<br>
        </tt><tt> </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; t = time(0); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; // get current
          time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;













        </tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; now =
          localtime(&amp;t);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // adjust for local
          timezone</tt><tt><br>
        </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; int hour = now-&gt;tm_hour; // retrieve
          current hour<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; int min = now-&gt;tm_min;&nbsp;&nbsp; // retrieve
          current min<br>
        </tt></font></p>
    <p>You will also need to include the ctime library (#include
      &lt;ctime&gt; at the top of your file).<br>
    </p>
    <p>In your submitted program, you should also state the test cases
      you tried, and why you picked those. Write these in <i>brief</i>
      comments. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Task 2<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Modify the above program as follow:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a prompt asking "How many minutes from now do you expect
        to be home?", and output a sentence saying "You will get home at
        HH:MM".</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>SUBMISSION</h3>
    <p>Your instructor will give you directions on how to submit the
      program.<br>
    </p>
    <p>You should have the following header on all programs this
      semester:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="+1"><tt>/*<br>
          &nbsp; Author: &lt;name&gt;<br>
          &nbsp; Course: {135,136}<br>
          &nbsp; Instructor: &lt;name&gt;<br>
          &nbsp; Assignment: &lt;title, e.g., "Lab 1"&gt;<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; This program does ...<br>
          */<br>
        </tt></font><font size="+1"><br>
      </font></blockquote>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>GRADING</h3>
    <p>All 135 and 136 programs this semester will be graded on: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Correctness: Does your program work? <br>
      </li>
      <li>Testing: Have you generated sufficient and good test data to
        give reasonable confidence that your program works?</li>
      <li>Structure: Have you structured your code to follow proper
        software engineering guidelines? This includes readability and
        maintainability. Note that <br>
      </li>
      <li>Documentation: How well documented is your code? Good
        documentation does not repeat the code in English, but explains
        the point of each code block, highlighting any design decisions
        and/or tricky implementation details. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To grade this lab, lets say:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>60  Correctness: 10-25-25 for the 3 tasks. Use your discretion for partial credit</li>
      <li>15  Testing: give full credit if they have shown any thught at all in stating test cases. Give 10, 5, or 0 for some/minimal/no thought.</li>
      <li>10  Structure: Mostly a free 10 pts, but take 1-2 points off if their indentation is weird.  0 if its a total mess.</li>
      <li>15  Documentation: 15 if its decent, 10 if its bad, 5 if its terrible, 0 if nonexistent</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
